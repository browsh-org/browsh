        The <a href="/">Swedish</a> word smörgåsbord consists of the words smörgås (sandwich,
        usually open-faced) and bord (table). Smörgås in turn consists of the
        words smör (butter, cognate with English smear) and gås. Gås literally
        means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that
        formed and floated to the surface of cream while it was churned.

        A special Swedish type of smörgåsbord is the julbord (literally "Christmas table").
        The classic Swedish julbord is central to traditional Swedish cuisine, often including
        bread dipped in ham broth and continuing with a variety of fish (salmon, herring,
        whitefish and eel), baked ham, meatballs, pork ribs, head cheese, sausages, potato,
        Janssons frestelse, boiled potatoes, cheeses, beetroot salad, various forms of boiled
        cabbage, kale and rice pudding.

        It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten
        with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong
        spirits like snaps, brännvin or akvavit with or without spices. Other traditional
        foods are smoked eel, rollmops, herring salad, baked herring and smoked salmon.
