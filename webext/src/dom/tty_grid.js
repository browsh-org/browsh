  // This is somewhat of a, hopefully elegant, hack. So, imagine that situation where you're
  // browsing a web page and a popup appears; perhaps just a select box, or menu, or worst
  // of all a dreaded full-page overlay. Now, DOM rectangles don't take into account whether
  // they are the uppermost visible element, so we're left in a bit of a pickle. The only JS
  // way to know if an element is visible is to use `Document.elementFromPoint(x, y)`, where
  // you compare the returned element with the element whose visibility you're checking.
  // This is has a number of problems. Firstly, it only checks one coordinate in the element
  // for visibility, which of course isn't going to 100% reliably speak for all the
  // characters in the element. Secondly, even ignoring the first caveat, running
  // `elementFromPoint()` for every character is very expensive, around 25ms for an average
  // DOM. So it's basically a no-go. So instead we take advantage of the fact that we're
  // working with a snapshot of the the webpage's pixels. It's pretty good assumption that if
  // you make the text transparent and a pixel's colour doesn't change then that character
  // must be obscured by something.
  //
  // There are of course some potential edge cases with this. What if we get a false
  // positive, where a character is obscured _by another character_? Hopefully in such a
  // case we can work with `z-index` so that characters justifiably overwrite each other in
  // the TTY grid.
